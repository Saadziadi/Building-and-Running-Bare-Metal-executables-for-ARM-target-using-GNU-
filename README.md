Bare-Metal Development:
In traditional embedded systems or certain types of applications, it's sometimes necessary to run software directly on the hardware without the abstraction provided by an operating system. This is known as bare-metal development.

ARM Architecture:
The project is specifically focused on ARM architectures, which are widely used in embedded systems, IoT devices, and various other applications. ARM processors are known for their energy efficiency and are commonly found in a range of devices.

GNU Toolchain:
The project utilizes the GNU toolchain for ARM, which includes essential tools like the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), GNU Binutils, and GDB (GNU Debugger). These tools are open-source and widely used for cross-compiling software for different architectures.

Building Executables:
The project involves writing software in a low-level language like C or assembly for ARM architecture.
The GNU toolchain is used to compile and link the source code, producing a bare-metal executable that can run directly on the ARM hardware.

Target Hardware:
The project specifies a target ARM hardware platform, which could be a development board or a custom hardware design with an ARM processor. The bare-metal executable is intended to run on this specific hardware.

No Operating System:
Unlike traditional software development that targets operating systems like Linux or Windows, bare-metal development does not rely on an operating system. The software interacts directly with the hardware peripherals and resources.
Peripheral Access and Initialization:

The bare-metal software might involve initializing and interacting with various hardware peripherals such as GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output), UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter), timers, and more.
Flashing and Running:

Once the bare-metal executable is built, it needs to be flashed onto the target ARM hardware. This is often done using tools like OpenOCD or specific vendor tools.
The software is then executed directly on the ARM processor, interacting with the hardware according to the program's logic.
